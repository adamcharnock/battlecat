Battlecat
=========

Battlecat is a general purpose double entry accounting web application.
Battlecat is based on `Hordak`_ and is currently a work in progress.

Requirements
------------

 * Django >= 1.8
 * Postgres >= 9.2
 * Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5
 * Linux or macOS

Documentation
-------------

Documentation TBA. However, see the `Hordak docs`_ to understand the core
mechanics.

Get involved
------------

Help is very welcome indeed. There isn't much here yet which makes it hard
to know where to start. However, we should have something rough sketched out
soon, at which point getting involved may be easier.

Of course, feel free to get in touch if you want to help out anyway. The
plan is to follow a path roughly similar to that of `Swiftwind`_, but
more general purpose.

  * Initial development by `Adam Charnock`_
